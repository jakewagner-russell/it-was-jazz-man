          <p>By 1933, the Alhambra nightclub, owned by Noodles Smith and Blackie Williams, had been renamed the Black and Tan and business was booming. Located on 12th Avenue South and Jackson Street, it was know as Seattle’s “most esteemed and longest lived nightclub,” and was later the inspiration for Duke Ellington’s famous short film and tune Black and Tan Fantasy. Smith owned numerous nightclubs during the 1920s and 1930s, for which Taylor dubs him the “impresario of black nightlife.” The Depression hit everyone in Seattle—but not Smith. He owned both a Stutz Bearcat and a 1921 Packard and his ostentatious lifestyle likely offended many in such hard times, especially racist whites who cursed the success of Black entrepreneurs. After the repeal of Prohibition, the police sometimes ignored the illegal practices (such as gambling) of most Jackson Street clubs. But police raids were common, and highly visible club owners like Smith attracted more attention from the often racist police institution.

          <p> While police raids were a constant annoyance, they rarely had lasting negative effects on popular clubs like the Black and Tan. Moreover, because public opinion generally sided with the club’s owner and patrons, raids created sympathy and sometimes additional patronage for Jackson Street night clubs. After the 1933 raid, the Black and Tan was operating at full capacity in no time, supplying Seattleites of all sorts with jazz and other “allurements.” Even repeated police raids and arrests could not shutdown a club with the popularity of the Black and Tan.

            For Jackson Street local and jazz pianist Palmer Johnson, what was intended to be a few months stay in Shanghai, ended up as a three-year adventure in which he played for bands in the Philippines, Malaysia, and Singapore. Upon his return to Seattle in 1937, Johnson found Jackson Street as alive as ever with a number of new clubs quickly gaining in popularity. President Roosevelt’s New Deal cash infusions put money into people’s pockets, which created demand for nighttime entertainment. There was a rapidly growing clientele for the up-and-coming nightclubs like the 411 Club at 411 Maynard Avenue South, just past Jackson Street; the Green Dot at 809 Jackson Street; the Ubangi at 710 7th Avenue South, a few blocks south of Jackson Street; and the Two Pals, the Congo Club, and the Black Elks Club as well. Clearly, the Jackson Street jazz clubs had only continued to multiply during Palmer Johnson’s extended absence.

          <p>
            In the climate of Roosevelt’s New Deal, Jackson Street jazz clubs began catering to more class-specific audiences. Noodles Smith, owner of the highly successful Black and Tan, saw the need for a more sophisticated club to satisfy the growing demand of wealthy whites for jazz venues. With this in mind, Smith opened the Ubangi club sometime after 1935 and according to Paul de Barros, it was “one of the Jackson Street district’s most successful and glamorous black-owned nightclubs.” The Ubangi had exquisite African themed décor, complete with potted palms, and it boasted two large stages, one on each of its floors. Smith spared few expenses, flying in musical and dance acts from Los Angeles, and as a result most of the patrons attracted to the club were white. But, even the lavish Ubangi continued to deal with problems of police harassment and, sadly, the Ubangi only operated for a few years before it closed in 1938 when the building was sold.

            While the Great Depression was ending, the swing era of jazz was just beginning. Jackson Street nightclubs like the Green Dot, the Black and Tan, and the Blue Rose (soon to be renamed the Rocking Chair) continued to operate into the 1940s and 1950s and Jackson Street remained the heart of Seattle’s jazz scene. The swing era attracted new listeners to jazz music, particularly young people. As swing developed, Seattle’s youth danced to big time jazz names like Duke Ellington, Benny Goodman, Woody Herman, and Gene Krupa, as well as to the local Jackson Street jazz musicians. Some of these big names even appeared in Jackson Street’s nightclubs. As swing gained in popularity, the Jackson Street clubs could no longer hold the swelling crowds and jazz spread throughout the city. However, Seattle jazz will always have its roots in the jazz clubs of Jackson Street.
