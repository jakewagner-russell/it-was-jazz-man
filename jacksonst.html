          <p>On June 10, 1918, Seattle saw its first local jazz band perform in Washington Hall, at 14th Avenue and Fir Street. Miss Lillian Smith’s Jazz Band played to raise money for the NAACP and officially opened Seattle’s local jazz scene. Although Washington Hall held many shows, the heart of Seattle jazz was just southeast at the corner of 12th and Jackson Street: according to historian Paul de Barros, “[t]his is where Seattle jazz was born and where it flowered.”
          </p>
          <p> Jackson Street became the hotbed for Seattle’s jazz scene primarily because of its proximity to the black community and because of the underground nightclub scene that developed during the Prohibition years. A steady stream of immigrants and migrants swelled Seattle’s population from 3,533 in 1880 to 80,671 in 1900. During this period, Yesler Way represented the dividing line between the more “respectable” parts of Seattle to the north, and the newly settled Yesler-Jackson community to the south. Previously the site of lavish Victorian homes, by 1890 Yesler-Jackson had an abundance of third-rate hotels, shops, bars, and brothels, which made the area decidedly lower-class. It was also the official destination for Seattle’s growing immigrant and migrant populations.

          <p id="float-p">
            Seattle’s black population numbered only 406 in 1900, but the following decades saw a sharp increase in black migration. Although blacks were never the racial majority in the Yesler-Jackson neighborhood, the area housed much of Seattle’s black population, which numbered 2,894 by 1920. black migrants brought with them jazz and musical traditions from around the country and, by the 1910s, Seattle’s “culture of legalized corruption...supported venues for music.” Prohibition, which began in Washington in 1916, prompted the need for underground clubs and speakeasies and city officials were all too eager to look the other way—and even encourage vice—upon receiving cash payment. Though Seattle’s jazz scene was still in its infancy, the city’s lenience toward illicit clubs allowed them to grow into what would become the future home for jazz on Jackson Street.

            The unique political and social climate of Prohibition and 1920s Seattle nurtured the rapid growth of the city’s nightlife and Jackson Street’s many clubs. In 1917, local entrepreneurs Russell “Noodles” Smith and Burr “blackie” Williams opened the Dumas Club at 1040 Jackson. A few years later, in 1920, Smith and Jimmy Woodland open the Entertainers Club at 12th and Jackson. With the nightlife heating up by 1922, in the basement of the Entertainers Club Smith and Williams “christened” the Alhambra, which became know as the black and Tan by 1932 and would become a hot spot for Seattle jazz during the Great Depression. While Jackson Street was always the heart of Seattle’s jazz scene, the nightlight extended to semi-legal “roadhouses” (freestanding nightclubs located on the outskirts of town) where alcohol and jazz flowed freely. Together, the roadhouses and the Jackson Street night clubs embedded jazz in Seattle’s nightlife and “[b]y 1928, jazz had taken over the popular music scene.” Clubs continued to pop up on and around Jackson Street—the Blue Rose (later called the Rocking Chair) on 14th and Yesler and the Chinese Garden’s Club (aka the Bucket of Blood), across from 511½ 7th Street South—and even when the stock market crashed and the Great Depression hit, there was no doubt that jazz would remain on Jackson Street.
