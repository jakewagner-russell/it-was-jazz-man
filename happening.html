          <p>In 1949, Seattle passed regulations which encouraged the growth of restaurant-lounge combinations and effectively phased out the flourishing nightclub scene of the thirties and early forties. When Boeing became established as one of the city’s biggest employers shortly thereafter, gave the city’s reputation as what Seattle music historian dubbed, “quiet, orderly, and dull.” Popular local talent such as Quincy Jones and Ray Charles sought greener pastures in larger music scenes in New York and Los Angeles. The climax of the Seattle jazz scene was finished. </p>

          <div class="left-photo" id="jimi" aria-label="Jimi Hendrix performing."></div>

          <p> Things stayed relatively quiet in the Seattle music scene until the early sixties, where R&amp;B and rock music took center stage and The Fabulous Wailers, The Fleetwoods, and The Ventures scored some national notoriety with a slew of hits. Jimi Hendrix played a vital role putting Seattle rock in the spotlight with a short, but storied, career, changing the course of popular music for good. Punk in the seventies and eighties, then grunge in the nineties overtook the music scene that Seattle became known for. </p>

          <div class="right-photo" id="tulas" aria-label="Tula's Jazz Club"></div>

          <p> Jazz may not be the shining light that it once was in the Emerald City, but it’s still vibrant throughout the city with many venues hosting local, national, and international talent. Modern Seattle jazz musicians have even caught national attention, most notably Kenny G and Bill Frisell, and have had key roles in defining the sound for each of their respected instruments. The history of the music will be forever engrained in the city’s fabric and regardless of prominence, the scene will continue to flourish for years to come.</p>
